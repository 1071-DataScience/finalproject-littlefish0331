# Project: Cut Down the Cost of Uncertainty travel order

### Groups
* Dept. of MIS - 林聖翔 Jack, 106356022
* Dept. of Statistics - 余佑駿 Steve, 106354005

### Goal
As a travel agency, they face a big trouble about uncertainty orders. For lots cancelled orders, it means the tour group  will be fail at last. However, to predict a order will be cancelled or not is a difficult thing. So in this competition, the Lion Travel provides data about flights  time, group price, people amount and day schedule. They wish participants can help them build a model to cut down the cost of uncertainty orders by ML.
All of all, our goal is to predict the order will be deal or not deal!
